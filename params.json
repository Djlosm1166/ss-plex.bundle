Without proper metadata, to save the TV Shows > Latest menu from becoming a wild list of episodes, it doesn’t really show /everything/ that comes in. However, browsing to a show always will.\r\n- There may be instances where a download fails and the channel still thinks you are downloading. This will break your queue. You will be presented with the option to Repair Downloads, which will try its best to fix things.\r\n\r\nStream Providers?\r\n=================\r\n\r\nSimply put, the many file/video hosting sites scattered across the internet.\r\n\r\nStreaming\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThere are two options for streaming. You can choose to either Watch Now, or select your preferred stream provider from a list.\r\n\r\nDownloading\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIf you choose to Watch Later, your media will be downloaded. You can choose to watch many things later and they will all be downloaded in sequence.\r\n\r\nWith myPlex set up on your Plex Server, you can now download tv shows and movies while away from home.\r\n\r\nWhen downloading TV Shows, you are expected to have at least one folder added to the TV Shows section of your Plex Library. Same goes for Movies. Filenames have .part added to them, so they won’t be picked up on regular scans. If a download is going too slow, you always have the option to try the next provider. Once a download is completed, it will update your Plex Library for you, so your media appears as soon as can be. If any attempt at downloading should fail or be cancelled, the .part file will be removed.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n====\r\n\r\n- Translations\r\n- iPhone / iPad support (how it works everywhere but here remains a mystery to me)\r\n","tagline":""}
